# CSC436-Project2

## Task:

Overview: The purpose of this project is to create a blog application using React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Vitest, and React Router. The blog server will be provided, and be a barebones implementation of RESTful HTTP routes to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) blog posts that persist in a data.json file. The server will provide routes for blog post creation, reading, updating, and deleting. The blog posts will consist of two properties: title and content, both of which should be treated as strings. In addition, the server will also provide properties for id, last updated, and originally published.
